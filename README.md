# Credit Score Prediction System for Bank Loans

## Description
This project leverages machine learning to predict the credit scores of individuals applying for bank loans. By analyzing customer data such as loan amounts, interest rates, and other personal details, the system evaluates the likelihood of loan approval and predicts credit scores to assist decision-making.
